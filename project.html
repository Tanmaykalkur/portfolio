			<p class="gap">|Role: Devoloper| <br>The obstacle avoidance robotics is used for detecting obstacles and avoiding the collision. This is an autonomous robot. The design of the obstacle avoidance robot requires the integration of many sensors according to their task.The Obstacle avoiding Robot we created was mainly based on the working principle of Ultrasonic sensor. Our Robot initially moves forward until it gets any kind of Obstacle. During driving, every time, it will check if there is any obstacle nearby by continuously sending and receiving distance-related information. The Trig pin will be used to send the signal, and the Echo pin will be used to listen for returning signal.</p>

				<li><strong>Skylight lamp:</strong></li><br>
				<p>|Role: Devoloper|<br>A skylight (sometimes called a rooflight) is a light-permitting structure or window, usually made of transparent or translucent glass, that forms all or part of the roof space of a building for daylighting and ventilation purposes.</p>

			<p class="gap">|Role: Devoloper|<br>Line follower is an autonomous robot which follows either black line in white are or white line in black area. Robot must be able to detect particular line and keep following it. For special situations such as cross overs where robot can have more than one path which can be followed, predefined path must be followed by the robot.</p>

				<li><strong>Smart GPS Geofencing system:</strong></li>
				<p>|Role: Devoloper|<br>Geofencing is a technology that uses location information from a smart device—like GPS, RFID, or Wi-Fi—to track whether a device is inside or outside a “fence,” a virtual boundary around an area in the real world. The technology is used for a variety of purposes, like security, location tracking, and advertising.</p>
